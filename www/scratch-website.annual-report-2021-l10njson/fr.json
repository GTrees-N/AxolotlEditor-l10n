    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP1": "En 2021, COVID-19 a continué à perturber nos habitudes et à façonner la façon dont nous interagissons les uns avec les autres. Même si nous avons commencé à nous rassembler, que les écoles ont rouvert et que des appels ont été lancés en faveur d'un « retour à la normale », les plus vulnérables de notre société ont été touchés de manière disproportionnée par les structures inéquitables que la COVID-19 a exacerbées. La crise du COVID-19 a façonné les relations des jeunes avec Scratch, et a consolidé Scratch comme un lieu plus vital que jamais pour créer, apprendre et se connecter. Mais alors que nous entrons dans une nouvelle année, nous n'avons pas laissé derrière nous nos jeunes les plus vulnérables alors qu'ils commencent à entrer dans une « nouvelle normalité ».",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP2": "L'une des valeurs fondamentales de Scratch a toujours été de donner aux jeunes les moyens d'explorer, de créer, de jouer et de découvrir — des possibilités qui ne sont pas offertes équitablement à tous les élèves.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessagePullquote": "Nous croyons au pouvoir transformateur de l'expression personnelle et de la créativité, et à la nécessité d'offrir un espace aux jeunes pour qu'ils utilisent le codage créatif comme un outil pour faire entendre leur voix.",

    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP4": "Last year was an incredible year for the Scratch Foundation–we focused on growing our team with remarkable, diverse leaders and building a solid foundation for our continued transition to an independent organization. We developed a three-year Strategic Plan with the combined efforts of every team member at every level of our organization, codifying the work we’re embarking on together. As Scratch grows, we remain focused on equity and community-building, and keeping Scratch a safe space for kids to connect, create, and collaborate with their peers around the world.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP5": "I can’t thank you enough for embarking on this journey with our team, and for your continued support of our mission.

    "annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText3": "My research group at the MIT Media Lab started collaborating with the LEGO company and LEGO Foundation more than 30 years ago. LEGO funding helped support our early work on Scratch, leading up to the public launch of Scratch in 2007. Then, when Scratch spun out of MIT into the Scratch Foundation in 2019, the LEGO Foundation provided important funding for the new organization, with a five-year $10 million grant to “support transformative educational change by developing and promoting playful, creative approaches to coding...in diverse economic and cultural contexts.” When the pandemic hit, the LEGO Foundation stepped up with an additional $5 million grant in 2021, to ensure that the Scratch Foundation could meet the needs of children and educators disrupted by the pandemic.",
    "annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText4": "But the LEGO-Scratch connection goes far beyond financial support. The Scratch approach of creating animated stories and games by snapping together graphical programming blocks was inspired, in part, by the way children build LEGO houses and castles by snapping together plastic LEGO bricks. Scratch and LEGO also share the same project-based educational philosophy, encouraging children to iteratively refine their projects by trying out an idea, seeing what happens, then making revisions and trying again.",
    "annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText5": "I’ve always loved the LEGO slogan “Joy of Building, Pride of Creation.” The LEGO Foundation’s deep partnership with the Scratch Foundation is helping to bring “Joy of Building, Pride of Creation” to children’s digital activities.
